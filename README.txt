"/sht enable" - Enables the addon if disabled.
"/sht disable" - Disables the addon and hides the text.
"/sht move" - Toggles the ability to drag/move the addon text.
"/sht hots" - Toggles whether the addon will show the Heal Over Time Spells: Renew, Rejuvinate or Regrowth.
"/sht help" - Displays a message describing each slash command in game.
